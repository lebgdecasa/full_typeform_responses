# Changes Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. `app.py` (Main Application)
**Status**: Completely updated
**Changes**:
- Added import for `form_config` module
- Enhanced `extract_form_id_from_webhook()` function to extract form ID from webhook data
- Added `load_prompt_template()` function to dynamically load templates from files
- Updated `generate_email_content()` to use form-specific templates
- Modified `send_email()` to accept custom from_email parameter
- Enhanced webhook handler with form ID extraction and validation
- Added form-specific logging and error handling
- Added `/forms` endpoint to list supported forms
- Updated MongoDB storage to include form metadata

### 2. `form_config.py` (Configuration System)
**Status**: New file
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration for all supported forms
**Contents**:
- `FORM_CONFIGS` dictionary mapping form IDs to configurations
- `get_form_config()` function to retrieve form-specific settings
- `get_supported_forms()` function to list all supported forms
- `extract_form_id_from_url()` utility function

### 3. Template Files (New Directory Structure)
**Status**: New files
**Location**: `templates/prompts/`
**Files**:
- `KdYBmq7K.txt`: Original Epiminded Growth Strategy template
- `EquFr0aR.txt`: Generic response template for form EquFr0aR
- `Tikf2fbS.txt`: Specialized response template for form Tikf2fbS

### 4. `test_form_routing.py` (Validation Script)
**Status**: New file
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of the multi-form system
**Features**:
- Tests form ID extraction from webhook data
- Validates form configuration lookup
- Checks template file existence and format
- Processes sample webhook data
- Provides detailed validation results

### 5. `README.md` (Documentation)
**Status**: New file
**Purpose**: Complete documentation of the multi-form system
**Contents**:
- Overview of new features
- File structure explanation
- Deployment instructions
- Testing procedures
- Instructions for adding new forms

### 6. `todo.md` (Progress Tracking)
**Status**: New file
**Purpose**: Track implementation progress through all phases

## Unchanged Files

- `requirements.txt`: No new dependencies required
- `Procfile`: Railway deployment configuration unchanged
- `railway.json`: Railway settings unchanged
- `render.yaml`: Render deployment configuration unchanged

## Key Improvements

### 1. Scalability
- Easy to add new forms without modifying core application code
- Template-based system allows non-technical customization
- Centralized configuration management

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between routing, templates, and configuration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Validation system to catch issues early

### 3. Flexibility
- Form-specific email subjects and senders
- Custom prompt templates for different use cases
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported forms

### 4. Reliability
- Robust form ID extraction from webhook data
- Template validation before processing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Deployment Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing webhook URL remains the same
- Original form (KdYBmq7K) continues to work exactly as before
- All environment variables remain unchanged

### New Capabilities
- Supports three forms instead of one
- Form-specific email customization
- Better error handling and logging
- New monitoring endpoint (`/forms`)

## Testing Results

All validation tests pass:
- ✓ Form ID extraction works correctly
- ✓ All three forms have valid configurations
- ✓ All template files exist and contain required placeholders
- ✓ Sample webhook processing works end-to-end
- ✓ Email extraction and form routing validated

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code to Railway
2. Test with actual webhook submissions from all three forms
3. Monitor logs to ensure proper form routing
4. Customize prompt templates for forms EquFr0aR and Tikf2fbS as needed
